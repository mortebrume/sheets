\chapter*{Features, Magic Items and Spells}

\section*{Fighter}
\subsection*{Fighting Style}
At 1st level, choose the Fighting Style from the options below that best reflect your martial training and skill with weapons. You cannot select a Fighting Style more than once, even if a feature allows you to select an additional Fighting Style.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can switch your Fighting Style for another Fighting Style of your choice.
\subsubsection*{Classical Swordplay}
While wielding a finesse weapon and no other weapons, you gain a +1 bonus to your attack rolls and a +1 to your Armor Class so long as you are not using heavy armor or a shield.

\subsection*{Second Wind}
Starting at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can do so again.

When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use your Second Wind feature twice between each short or long rest.

\subsection*{Martial Exploits}
At 2nd level, you have begun to master unique techniques to enhance your martial skill, both on and off the field of battle.

\subsubsection*{Exploit Dice}
The Fighter table shows how many Exploit Dice you have to perform the Exploits you know. To use an Exploit, you must expend one of these Dice. You can only use one Exploit per attack, ability check, or saving throw, and you regain your expended Exploit Dice when you finish a short or long rest.

Your Exploit Dice begin as d6s, and increase in size as you gain levels in this class, as indicated in the Fighter table.

\subsubsection*{Exploits Known}
You know two Exploits of your choice from the list at the end of this class. The Exploits Known column of the Fighter table shows when you learn more Exploits of your choice. To learn an Exploit you must meet any prerequisites it may have, like a minimum Ability Score or a minimum fighter level.

Whenever you gain a fighter level, you can replace one of the Exploits you know with another Exploit of your choice.

\subsubsection*{Saving Throws}
If one of your Exploits requires a creature to make a saving throw, your Exploit saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

\subparagraph*{Exploit save DC} = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

\subsection*{Know Your Enemy}
Beginning at 3rd level, you can measure the skills of others in comparison to your own. As an action, choose a creature you can see within 60 feet. You learn if it is your equal, superior, or inferior in regards to one of the following attributes:

\begin{DndTable}{cX}
    Armor Class                        & Strengh Score                          \\
    Current or Total Hit Points        & Dexterity Score                         \\
    Proficiency Bonus                  & Constitution Score                       \\
    Fighter Class Levels               & Exploits Known                            \\
\end{DndTable}

Once you learn something about a creature, you can't use this feature on that creature again until you finish a long rest.

When you reach 14th level in this class, you can use this feature as either an action or bonus action on your turn.

\subsection*{Extra Attack}
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

When you reach certain levels in this class, the number of attacks you can make as part of your Attack action increases; at 11th level (3 attacks) and at 17th level (4 attacks).

\subsection*{Action Surge}
Starting at 6th level, you can push yourself past your limits, if only for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action on that current turn. Once you do so, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

When you reach 20th level, you can use this feature twice between each short or long rest, but only once per turn.

\section*{Swordsage}
\subsection*{Student of the Blade}
In your studies you have mastered other skills adjacent to swordplay. You gain proficiency in one of the following skills: Athletics, Acrobatics, Insight, Intimidation, or Performance.

Whenever you make an ability check with the chosen skill you gain a bonus to your roll equal to your Exploit Die.

\subsection*{Battle Trance}
So long as you are not wearing heavy armor or a shield, you can use a bonus action to enter a Battle Trance. Your Battle Trance grants you the following benefits for 1 minute:
\begin{itemize}
    \item You can take the Dash action as a bonus action.
    \item You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class.
    \item You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
    \item Once per turn when you use a Swordsage Exploit, you can roll a d4 instead of expending one of your Exploit Dice.
\end{itemize}
Your Battle Trance ends early if you are incapacitated, or you don a shield or heavy armor. Once you enter your Battle Trance you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. If you have no uses of this feature remaining, you can expend an Exploit Die to enter a Battle Trance again.

\subsection*{Reflexes of the Sage}
You have honed your reflexes to a point in pursuit of martial perfection. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws, and you add your proficiency bonus to your initiative rolls.

Also, while you are in your Battle Trance, the bonus to your Armor Class increases by 1, for a total bonus of +2.

\section*{Background}
\subsection*{Far Traveler}
You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects taxes, and wields significant political influence.

You come from an established family in another land to the north, and have been outcast as you are the only member of your family to display sorcerous trait, and seek adventure to discover more about this element of your being.

\subparagraph*{Skill Proficiencies} Insight, Perception
\subparagraph*{Tool Proficiencies} Any one musical instrument or gaming set of your choice, likely something native to your homeland
\subparagraph*{Languages} One of your choice
\subparagraph*{Equipment} One set of traveler's clothes, any one musical instrument or gaming set you are proficient with, poorly wrought maps from your homeland that depict where you are in Faerûn, a small piece of jewelry worth 10 gp in the style of your homeland's craftsmanship, and a pouch containing 5 gp

\subsubsection*{All Eyes on You}
Your accent, mannerisms, figures of speech, and perhaps even your appearance all mark you as foreign. Curious glances are directed your way wherever you go, which can be a nuisance, but you also gain the friendly interest of scholars and others intrigued by far-off lands, to say nothing of everyday folk who are eager to hear stories of your homeland.

You can parley this attention into access to people and places you might not otherwise have, for you and your traveling companions. Noble lords, scholars, and merchant princes, to name a few, might be interested in hearing about your distant homeland and people.


\section*{Feats}
\subsection*{Sentinel}
You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
    \item Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
    \item When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Defensive Duelist}
\textit{Prerequisite: Dexterity 13 or higher}\\
When you are wielding a finesse weapon with which you are proficient and another creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to add your proficiency bonus to your AC for that attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

\section*{Shadar-kai}
\subsection*{Blessing of the Raven Queen}
As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Starting at 3rd level, you also gain resistance to all damage when you teleport using this trait. The resistance lasts until the start of your next turn. During that time, you appear ghostly and translucent.

\subsection*{Darkvision}
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.

\subsection*{Fey Ancestry}
You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the charmed condition on yourself.

\subsection*{Necrotic Resistance}
You have resistance to necrotic damage.

\subsection*{Trance}
You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.

Whenever you finish this trance, you can gain two proficiencies that you don't have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.

\section*{Martial Exploits}
\subsection*{1st-Degree Exploits}
Exploits of the 1st-degree are minor techniques slightly more complicated then swinging a weapon. They can be learned by warriors with modest training and have no level prerequisite.

\subsubsection*{Feint}
When you make a melee weapon attack against a creature that can see you, you can expend an Exploit Die to attempt
a feint as part of that attack. The target of your attack must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or you add your Exploit Die to both your attack roll and damage roll for that attack.

\subsubsection*{Lightstep}
\textit{Prerequisites: Dexterity of 11}\\
Whenever you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Dexterity (Stealth) check, or roll initiative, you can expend an Exploit Die and add it to your roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether you succeed or fail.

\subsubsection*{Mighty Leap}
\textit{Prerequisites: Strength of 11}\\
When you make a running or standing jump, you can expend an Exploit Die to increase your jump distance by a number of feet equal to 5 times the Exploit Die roll (minimum of 5 feet), even if this distance would exceed your remaining speed.

\subsubsection*{Warding Strike}
When a creature moves into the reach of a melee weapon you are wielding, you can use your reaction to expend an Exploit Die and make a melee weapon attack against that creature. On hit, you add your Exploit Die to the damage of the attack.

\subsection*{2nd-Degree Exploits}
Exploits of the second degree represent the peak martial skill achievable by a warrior without dedicated training. These Exploits can be learned by any fighter of 5th level or higher.

\subsubsection*{Exposing Strike}
\textit{Prerequisites: 5th level}\\
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die to temporarily weaken it. The first attack made against it before the start of your next turn has advantage and deals extra damage equal to your Exploit Die.

\subsubsection*{Martial Focus}
\textit{Prerequisites: 5th level}\\
When you make a weapon attack, you can expend an Exploit Die as part of the attack to grant yourself advantage on your attack roll. You can use this Exploit after you roll, but before you know whether your attack hits or misses your target.

\subsubsection*{Warrior's Challenge}
\textit{Prerequisites: 5th level}\\
As a bonus action, you can expend an Exploit Die and force
a creature within 30 feet that can see or hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on any attack roll it makes against targets other than you for one minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This effect ends early if you attack a creature other then the target.

\subsubsection*{Whirlwind Strike}
\textit{Prerequisites: 5th level, Strength or Dexterity of 13}\\
In place of an attack, you can expend an Exploit Die and force each creature within range of melee weapon you are wielding to make a Dexterity saving throw. They take damage equal to your Exploit Die + either your Strength or Dexterity modifier on a failure, and half as much on a successful save.

\subsubsection*{Zephyr Slash}
\textit{Prerequisites: 5th level, Strength or Dexterity of 13}\\
As an action, you can expend an Exploit Die and flourish your melee weapon then instantly move up to 30 feet in a straight line. Creatures you pass through must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage equal to twice your Exploit Die + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).

This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
